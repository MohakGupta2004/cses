From this we got to know about cycle sort algorithm and how it works. Basically if the number is from 1 - n then the element of index will be +1 from the index. From this we can sort the array and compare it in O(nlogn)


From O(n) we can take all the number which are in input and plus it and take the sum of all the index values and compare it then it'll give which was missing.
